# Beispielprojekt AppStore 

This guide is based on two examples to build REST services with Spring:

- https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/bookmarks/
- https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/



== What you'll build

You'll build a service that will accept CRUD (HTTP POST, HTTP GET, HTTP PUT, HTTP DELETE) requests at:

----
http://localhost:8080/apps
----

- GET http://localhost:8080/apps: lists all 'Apps' of the AppStore
- GET http://localhost:8080/apps/{id}: lists the 'App' with the given {id}
- POST http://localhost:8080/apps and in JSON Body title, text, tags: adds one 'App' to the AppStore
- PUT http://localhost:8080/apps/{id} and in JSON Body title, text, tags: changes the 'App' with the given {id}
- DELETE http://localhost:8080/apps/{id}: deletes the 'App' with the given {id}
